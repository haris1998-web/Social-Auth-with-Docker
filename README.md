# Social-Auth-with-Docker

This project is a web application that utilizes Django as the backend framework, React as the frontend library, Docker for deployment and Nginx as a web server.

# Backend (server)
The backend of the application is developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework. It provides a powerful and flexible architecture for building web applications. Django comes with many built-in features such as user authentication, admin panel, and ORM, which makes it easy to develop web applications quickly.

# Frontend (social_auth)
The frontend of the application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a flexible and efficient way to create reusable UI components. The frontend communicates with the backend using APIs developed in Django.

# Docker
The application is deployed using Docker, a containerization platform. Docker provides a way to package the application along with its dependencies into a container, which can be easily deployed to any environment. The containerization also ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments.

# Nginx
The application is served using Nginx, a high-performance web server. Nginx is known for its scalability and efficiency, making it an ideal choice for serving web applications.

Overall, this project leverages the power of Django, React, Docker and Nginx to develop and deploy a scalable and efficient web application.
